Detailing my approach
--------------------

## Step 1:
- Chose to start with testing for an airport class and then setting it's state in terms of capacity
  - Decided to amend the domain model structure shown to us during the week slightly to include a third 'state' column in the table

## Step 2:
- Decided to define a plane class and test that it responds to all the methods/messages defined in the domain model

##Step 3:
- Next step seemed to be to create some memory between the methods so that planes can be stored at different airports
